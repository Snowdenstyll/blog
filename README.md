# Ruby on Rails Getting Started Guide

## Overview
Trying out Ruby on Rails.<br/>
This is a basic Ruby on Rails application that follows the guide from the official [Rails Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) documentation.<br/>

## Run Locally
Clone the repository:
